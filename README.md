The Movie Theater Seating Challenge

Simply clone this repo, or download it as a zip file.

To test, make a txt file with the input, store it somewhere.

In the command line, execute the program with the full path to the input file.

Otherwise, it is assumed that the input file is in the same directory as this program.

You can specify an absolute path and name where you want the output file to go with the second argument.

Otherwise, the output file will go to the directory where this program is at.

If you do not provide the output file name, the output file will be called output.txt and will go to this current directory.

Please note that currently, if you give an absolute path to the file for the output, we assume the file already exists.

To test, go to the directory where this program is located.

Then, compile all .java files with javac.

Lastly, run your program with java Main input.txt output.txt 

where output.txt is optional.

For your convenience, I recommend moving the input.txt to the current directory so you can use the command above directly.
